I am a doctoral candidate and researcher in Data Science and Sports Economics at the University of Tuebingen. My current research leverages sports data and economic principles to investigate human behavior. I am particularly interested in how discrimination shapes outcomes in labor markets and education, integrating machine learning with applied econometrics to identify causal impacts. Ultimately, I strive to create research that not only illuminates the "what" but also provides compelling answers to the "why" and "how" of human behavior.
