Based on the seminal work of Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman there is an understanding that humans think heuristically. Tversky and Kahneman (1974) say "These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors." Those systematic and predictable errors can also be labeled as bias. In this course, you will gain a foundational understanding of behavioral and cognitive bias, and then see how it applies to sports.
