At the direction of Gábor Békés and with further help from Zsuzsa Vadle. This course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity. We will focus on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral's Le Chat, and Google's Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. The course will focus on data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports. The course involves a great deal of hands-on practice with weekly case studies and assignments. Also a bit of Data Analysis where ideas like data wrangling, documentation, and regression interpretation will come back.
